This is a project from GPR_200 Intro to Mondern Graphics Programming at Champlain College 2020

On branches Lab-7 and Lab-8v2 I developed a shader in GLSL using the Shadered tool. 

Lab-7: Learned the diffrence between Vertex and Fragment Shader, Mapped a texture to a 3D Object, and implemented Phong-Reflectance

Lab-8v2:m Continued understanding Vertex shaders, implemented bloom/muti-pass postprocessinga and implemented shadow mapping
